## 🚀 Philosophy

I believe in **server-driven efficiency** over abstraction layers. While JavaScript frameworks are good in their own merit, it piles on syntactic sugar, it's ideal to focus on **functionality and performance** to deliver scalable software with tangible results and easy decomposition. Less overhead, more impact.
